I was a co-author on my first [Nature paper](https://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v551/n7678/full/nature24471.html) the other day.
It presents a measurement of the Hubble parameter (a measure of how fast the Universe is expanding), using gravitational waves
and several types of follow-up observations. It's the first-ever measurement of this kind. (That's why it's in Nature.)
There was a short blurb about it ORNL today, but naturally that's an internal network only thing so I can't link to it here.
Most people won't understand it, but the money plot from the paper is below.

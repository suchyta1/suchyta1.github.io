Welcome to my brand new website. I've been brushing up on my HTML and CSS, because it's finally time to spiff up my Internet presence.
I'm not a web expert, but if you're looking to create your own website and have at least slightly nonzero web development experience,
I would recommend checking out [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and building with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).
It's definitely not as easy as using something like Wix, Weebly, or WordPress, but it's not really powerful and maybe
more important to me, it's completely portable. Blogging-style posts come for free, so I'm trying it out at least to start, 
and we'll see if it sticks.

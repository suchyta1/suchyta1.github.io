I had an enjoyably miserable morning running in the Covenant Health Knoxville (half) Marathon on April 2, 2017. 
It was my first real race, beyond stuff that doesn't really count. If you don't know the area, this race has 
a reputation for being pretty darn challenging hill-wise, which suits my challenge-seeking outlook.
